 Music Recommendation System with 8 ML Algorithms
 A Flask-based web application that predicts music preferences using 8 machine learning models.

 Features

- *8 ML Algorithms**:
  - Regression: Linear Regression, KNN
  - Classification: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, Gradient Boosting
- *Key Functionalities**:
  - Predict missing song ratings
  - Classify songs as Like/Dislike
  - Analyze user taste clusters
- *Interactive Web Interface**:
  - Rate songs (1-10)
  - View model predictions in real-time

Technologies Used

- Python 3.8+
- Flask (Web Framework)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
- NumPy, Pandas (Data Processing)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend)

 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
